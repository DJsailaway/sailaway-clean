Dear ${name},

Thank you for your request to hire ${bookings.map((b) => b.boat).join(", ")} for ${bookings.map((b) => b.isMultiDay ? `${b.days} days` : b.duration).join(", ")} on ${date}, meeting at ${location} at ${time}.

We'll check the tides and availability and give you a call to confirm the final details as soon as we can.

We take a deposit of one third of the total hire cost (£${Number(total).toFixed(2)}) when a booking is confirmed. If your hire is due to commence within the next fortnight, we'll instead take payment in full over the phone.

Please take a moment to have a look at our FAQs:

We look forward to getting you afloat!

Yours sincerely,
The Sailaway Team
